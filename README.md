Complete do-over of full stack web application for UW Coding Bootcamp, Final Group Project, January 2020

* Frontend (React)
* Backend (Express)
* Database (MySQL)

And to deploy, Frontend to Netlify and Backend to Heroku.

## Branches

#### Inspired by gitflow.

* 'master': This is the production branch.
* 'develop': This is where we all merge our changes together before it goes to prod.
* 'working branches': We will use a naming convention like this 'candice/mything'.  These are our personal branches for doing our assigned feature.

#### The rules:
* 'master': Must be clean, tests passing, software working correctly.
* 'develop': Should almost always be clean, tests passing, software working correctly. Avoid breaking develop rules unless it is absolutely necessary to get through some large refactor or something.
* 'yourname/yourthing': Do whatever you want.
* It is not recommended to delete prior/old branches in GitHub, until/unless the total number of branches is truly problematic.
